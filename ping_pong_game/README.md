# Ping Pong Game
This is a simple Ping Pong game written in Python using the Turtle graphics library. It includes a player, a ball, a field, and two scores. The game is played by two players, with the objective of hitting the ball over the net and preventing it from touching the ground on their side. The first player to reach a certain number of points wins the game.

Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the game:

Python 3.x
Turtle graphics library
Installation
To install and run the game, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the source code.
Install Python 3.x and the Turtle graphics library.
Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the source code is located.
Run the command python3 pingpong.py to start the game.
Usage
To play the game, follow these instructions:

Use the Up and Down arrow keys to move the first player's paddle up and down.
Use the W and S keys to move the second player's paddle up and down.
Press the Space key to pause and resume the game.
The game ends when one of the players reaches the set number of points.
To exit the game, click anywhere on the screen.
Code Overview
The pingpong.py file contains the main game loop and imports the following modules:

player.py: defines the Player class, which creates the two player paddles.
ball.py: defines the Ball class, which creates the ball.
field.py: defines the Field class, which creates the playing field.
score.py: defines the Score class, which keeps track of the players' scores.
The game loop runs continuously until one of the players wins the game. The loop updates the screen and checks for collisions with the paddles and the walls. If a collision occurs, the ball changes direction. If a player scores a point, the ball is reset to the other side of the screen and the game is paused for a short time.

Conclusion
This Ping Pong game is a simple and fun way to learn and practice Python programming skills. It can be easily customized and expanded to add new features and functionality.
